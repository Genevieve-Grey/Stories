The flesh of the mandarin gives way easily to my fingernail, allowing itself to be pierced by the filmy point. Its scent is intoxicating, immediately fresh and sharp. 
 
The citrus is made for two; Where are you?  
 

My fingers are stained with orange, scent and color, lingering heavily on my skin, the pith is under my nails now. 

The peel is everywhere; it’s in my car and purse and on my notebook and tucked against the pages of my book to be found much later, when it has shriveled into itself and its essence has sunk into the fibers of the pages, leaking beside the darkly stamped words. Something much brighter than the sun has been allowed to infiltrate these corners, purify them, touching them so gently that I would think it was your lips. 

I am sticky with mess, the pulp and pith and juice have gotten everywhere; it has dripped from the fruit to my lips to my fingers and everywhere in between. Elegant inelegance to lick it off, savoring the taste in the space between my fingers and the tender spot in the center of my palm.  

A merciful God has split love delicately for us and called it a citrus.
