# Chapter 1
It was late in the year. The leaves were starting to turn browns, reds, oranges, yellows. The air was sweet chilly and delicious. It was the time of year I loved most: watching horror movies in blankets, the warm drinks, the sweaters. I was brand new in that season, life exhaled into my heavy lungs.

“Aphrodite! Why don’t you come down to Richard’s with us tonight? There’s supposed to be a party.” My dearest, sweetest friend Blake called from across the lawn. We had just exited our afternoon classes at our university, her from the south building and me from the west. We met in the middle of the large lawn in between the buildings, our feet crunching in the brown grass.

I sucked my teeth, thinking. I didn’t usually go to parties, but I loved Richard. And wherever Richard went, so did Finn. I loved Finn, too. The boys, I had known from the start of our time at this college, three years ago. We were fast friends, bonding over shared classes and people we disliked. Blake, I had known for years. She was my right-hand man since high school, however, it was never exactly ‘pleasant’ between us. We started out disliking each other, fighting over the top grades and elected positions for student council, honors classes, and volunteering. It was only in junior year that we began to bond, completely over the fight that lasted nearly all of our high school. It was nearing the end of that time, and school no longer mattered to us; not with the air warming, with summer coming up fast, and our responsibilities both building up and dropping off with senior year approaching and finals over.

“I suppose I could join in. What time?” I asked. She stopped in front of me, squinting. That beautiful curly hair of hers fluttered in the fall wind. I was always jealous of her hair. I was jealous of everything about her, honestly. She was beautiful. She was kind funny and smart. What was there not to envy?

“Really? You never agree to come.” She asks. One of her well-groomed eyebrows rose high on her forehead. She crossed her long, thin arms and tapped a foot. It crunched marvelously in the grass. 

I shrugged. My lips pursed as I feigned nonchalance. I had wanted to go to the party because I had been feeling lonely. Richard and Finn had stopped inviting me to things after a while. I had declined events too many times, telling them I needed to get home to care for my parents, for my dog, to do homework, to do laundry. They stopped extending invitations after a while, not even offering a pitying invitation over text saying a half-hearted ‘we’re having a thing later if you want, it’s cool if you can’t come, though’.

At first, I was grateful. I didn’t know their friends and their friends didn’t know me. I had responsibilities. I had after-school activities and things I had to attend to. I had a family that needed me. I had a dog that I missed and was getting old. Then, though…I was sad. I was lonely. My sister had finally gotten home from New York, where she was studying music, and could take care of my parents. She could also care for my dog. That took care of half of my night. I started studying in the library on my breaks between classes, eliminating most of my homework for at night. Then I was just sad and alone, watching my phone for a buzz that I prayed was one of my friends inviting me to a party, telling me they missed me and wanted me around, saying the party wasn’t right without me there. I just wanted to be wanted.

So I had shrugged, and smiled, a little embarrassed. My heart tightened a little. I waited for her to tell me I didn’t need to come, that it was all fine without me, or something along those lines. I feared those words. Those were the words that would break my heart. 

Blake only grinned, hooking her arm through mine. She led me down the lawn and towards our next class, which we had together. It was the best time of the school day when I got to be with my friend. When class was less isolating. I suppose class isn’t meant to be ‘bonding’, but it is nice to feel the comfort of having someone you know with you in an unfamiliar class, where people already seem to know each other and leave you behind to feel awkward and a little ashamed when you work with them in a group of three.

“I’m so excited. You’re gonna love it. I have to introduce you to some of my friends. They’re gonna love you. You’re gonna love them. They’re so fun.” Blake had said. 

A kernel of jealousy made its way into my traitorous little heart and made me want to distance myself from Blake. She always was so charismatic, even when she thought she wasn’t. She always knew exactly what to say. I loved her for it. And yet I hated her for it because it meant she had all these friends that I didn’t know. I imagined she liked them better than she liked me, and she preferred to hang out with them and that’s why she didn’t visit me when I was alone at night and she was still awake and likely partying. 

I pushed those thoughts away. I had told myself I was going to love her friends, and they would be nice, and we would all be a group. A few additions to our little family of friends, us and the boys, couldn’t hurt. More friends would never be a problem, I imagined. 

“Okay. I look forward to it.” I murmured. I still felt that flutter of anxiety in my stomach, and then that piece of resentment at myself for being upset at Blake for having more friends. As if she couldn’t have more than our group. I didn’t have more than our group, though. But that doesn’t mean I should limit her, I supposed. I tried to focus on our next class, and the feeling of her arm in mine, and the weight of my bag on my shoulder. I focused on the crunchy grass and sweet air that I loved.

“Ready for class? Did you do that writing assignment?” Blake asked me. 

Inhaling deeply, I turned to Blake with my brightest smile. “I did. Did you?” I knew Blake never really did her homework on time. It was always a day or two late, but the teachers rarely docked her for that. She was good with words. She was persuasive and witty, and they loved her. 

Blake had laughed, thinking the same thing I was. “Not a chance.”

- 

The party had been in between the apartments of Richard and Finn (who shared an apartment with one other guy I didn’t know of, but later learned whose name was Alec) and their neighbors, Sara and Quintessa. Blake had cracked a joke about the name Quintessa, which neither of us had heard before. Richard shot us a look and told us to shut up. We knew he liked her just for that. How could the guy who made fun of everyone possibly get mad at us for doing the same?

Blake and I showed up after returning to our dorm for a few minutes to change. We had changed and showed up just on time, if not a little early. We had texted Richard and Finn and offered to help them set up, and they had accepted gladly, sending a bunch of ‘thank you’ and ‘we’ll worship you forever’ texts. We decided we couldn’t pass up a chance to be worshipped eternally. Richard and Finn greeted us at the door, led us inside the small dorm, and showed us to the small kitchen to the right. 

“Put out chips and the sodas that are in the fridge. I want them out in a bowl of ice.” Richard demanded, pointing harshly to the fridge. Finn had rolled his eyes and smacked Richard’s arm down, which earned him a stern look before Richard swept away with a dramatic flare of his jacket.

“He meant to say ‘please’, too. Aphrodite, do you mind doing that? I need Blake to help me grab some extra chairs from Sara.” Finn had gently mended, giving us both kind eyes and a warm smile. That expression had always melted the ice in my heart, whether I was upset over school or sad about my family, and most often was followed by a tight hug.

I guess I prepped myself for a hug, then. I leaned forward, and my arms twitched up. But it had been a while since had last seen Finn, between our classes and the parties I wasn’t invited to, and the embrace didn’t come. I felt cold and embarrassed and turned away swiftly to attend to my task. Humiliation followed me and made me warm all over even when I opened the fridge and felt that chill hit me.

“Why don’t you just forget about the chairs? Sara can set them up in her place and people can migrate.” Blake had said, a laugh at the edge of her voice. She was always quick to laugh. I loved that about her, too.

“Nah, people like to eat and chat in here and then go to Sara and Quintessa’s to dance and mingle around her drinks. We don’t keep a lot of alcohol around here after that last time the campus police were called. We do not want that again.” Finn had laughed.

“Oh my God. Yeah, we don’t want that again. I remember that.” Blake giggled with him, and I heard the sound of her slapping Finn’s shoulder. She did that a lot. Especially to Finn. For a while, I had considered if she liked him, and asked her once, but she scrunched her nose and told me I was crazy. I did not miss the way she quickly changed the subject afterward.

I don’t know when the police were called. I didn’t even know that happened. I almost want to turn around, laugh, and ask them why they never told me about that. I decided against it out of fear that that would sound too pushy and ‘why am I always left out’-ish, which could have made me sound like I wanted pity or something. That’s the last thing I wanted. I didn’t want them to get that sad look in their eyes, to hang their heads and come up with a half-assed excuse as to why they never told me to join them anytime.

I kept my mouth firmly shut and focused on putting ice into a bowl for the sodas. I listened to their conversation drifting away as they left for the apartment opposite. Richard clanked around in another room, made a snide comment to Alec, and then there was a smacking noise.

“You moron.” I heard Alec say, but then I heard laughter. The laughter in the other room both softened my heart and made it heavy with sadness. I wanted to be the one laughing with someone, I wanted to be a part of a group with inside jokes, and yet I loved to hear that distant laughter. That muffled sound, it’s just a comfort. Someone is having fun. Someone is laughing in the next room.

“Aphrodite! That’s the wrong bowl.” Richard cried, pounding into the room on his heavy feet. He had big feet and wore heavy black boots, making him a force as he stumbled into the room. Just to add to that, he had a power walk that commanded attention, made his feet slap the floor, drew eyes, and rattled bottles on particularly loose shelves. He scared me a little when I first met him, but Finn assured me later that he was a good guy, he was just a bit standoffish and, sometimes, overconfident.

I had blushed heavily, fumbling between putting everything back and dumping it all into another bowl and saying fuck it. I ended up doing a back-and-forth motion, looking robotic as I moved jerkily from the fridge to the half-full bowl of sodas.

“You didn’t tell me to use anything else. You just said to put it in a bowl.” I replied. I think I had kept my voice strong, but looking back, it might have wavered. The disappointment in his voice made my pulse fluttering like a bird in my throat.

Richard had scoffed, putting his long fingers to his temples. He wore heavy silver rings. I remember that especially. He had long, slim fingers. They looked elegant. I liked them. I told him once that I liked his fingers, that I thought they were cool, and he raised a brow at me (I knew this was an odd compliment, but I said it anyways, much to my later embarrassment) but smirked nonetheless.

    “I was blessed with my mother’s genes.” He had said. A confidence that only comes from being complimented had filled his tone. 

    “I can see,” I replied, looking down at my fingers. They were proportionate to my hand, but not bad-looking. They were average, I supposed.

“I thought you would assume to put them in that bowl I left there.” Richard had muttered, gesturing to the glass bowl on the counter, tucked in the corner between the wall and the fridge. This had only made me blush harder, embarrassed by my stupidity. Of course, he wanted me to use that bowl. I had looked right over it.

“I’m so sorry. I can change it.” I had stuttered, feeling like a waiter who got an order wrong. The skin on the back of my neck had prickled with heat and shame.

Richard had sighed, closed his eyes, and taken a moment. I watched him decompress, taking several breaths. His face seemed to get less red, turning back to its usual pale complexion. He eventually opened his eyes again, fixing me with a patient look, tinged with an apology I knew he wouldn’t utter aloud.

“Okay. That’s fine. Just dump it all into the other bowl. Want me to help?” He had asked, his voice softer now. I watched Alec behind him, who raised a brow at the softness that was so rarely heard from Richard except when he felt truly bad for his behavior. 

I shook my head and began removing the sodas to dump the ice into the glass bowl. “Nah. That’s okay. Do whatever else you have to do.” I had said. Richard watched me for a moment more before leaving, following my directions and preparing the small living room. 

An hour or so passed without me noticing, and soon enough our group was back together in the living room and waiting for people to arrive. The front door hung open, an invitation. The counters had chips and dip, several kinds of candies, and drinks set in a random array for people to grab from. The place smelt vaguely of Febreze air freshener in an ‘ocean breeze’ scent, and it tickled my nose. I didn’t like that scent, how artificial it was. I wondered if Alec, Richard, or Finn had liked it more. It didn’t even really matter that much.

Soon enough, people had filled the dorm. They trickled in, two or three, a group of five, ten at once, just a few, too many to fit in the door together. They were a wild stream of people, more than I’d ever seen in one dorm room at once. My shirt was immediately damp with nervous sweat, my smile terse, my chest tight. I remembered, then, why I didn’t go to parties. I didn’t know anyone there.

Blake, my dearest, the person who had loved me and I had loved the most, hooked her arm through mine and brought me off of the couch. She had paraded me around the room, dragging me from group to group as she mingled and chatted with people. Sometimes I would hear her say ‘What’s your name?’ And came to the striking realization that she didn’t know these people; she just walked up to them and joined their conversation, a stranger putting input on a subject she didn’t know about. But they had accepted her with smiles and tips of their heads and cups, telling her their names and filling her in on their little arguments and lives.

The room was hot. It was loud. I wondered all the time if the people in the surrounding dorms hated us. They probably did, looking back. God, they probably hated how loud we were. How obnoxious. Hated that people scraped chairs loudly, played music over the raucous talking, laughed too loud and shrill, and danced with heels and boots all over the old wood. I hated us. I hated that place. I wished, over and over and over, that I wouldn’t have agreed. I imagined my cozy little room, the books I would read by my lamp, the softness of my sheets. I missed it with such a burning passion, that my entire chest hurt. Or maybe that was just the tight clench of anxiety. 

It felt as if people were watching me, judging me, knowing that I had never been to a place like that before, and I hated it, and they didn’t know me and I never wanted to know them. Blake had continued to drag me around. She introduced me to person after person, and I watched as, person after person, I would get up-and-down looks, barely noticeable pity smiles, and strange looks as they sized me up. Who is this creature next to our beautiful Blake? They likely asked themselves. I thought that they thought that a lot. I watched myself, in my mind I had a person, most of the time a man, who watched me and my actions and my thoughts and judged them, who I was then watching. I was a woman with a man watching me who I also watched. I was that Margaret Atwood quote. I was constantly surveying myself, wondering about myself, striving to look the best and sound the best and be the best, and yet I guess I never achieved that. I guess I’ve always just been me. I was named after the goddess of beauty and yet I thought of myself as Eris, or maybe Mnemosyne.

It was getting late then. I think it was just past ten when someone passed a drink into my hand. I had wavered, staring into the light blue concoction. I didn’t like blue drinks. Blue wasn’t supposed to be in drinks. And I had heard, from my friends, family members, people online, that you, a woman, should never drink a drink offered by someone you don’t know. After a long moment of thinking, I drank it. I threw my head back, shut my eyes tight, and cringed as the sour drink flooded my throat and burned my chest. I wrinkled my nose, my entire face scrunching. I think people around me cheered. Another drink was shoved into my hand and the previous cup was whisked away. 

Encouraged by the cheering, the attention, and the sudden ease in my chest after the first drink, I had shot the second. More cheering. More drinks. More pats on the back and shouts and crowds around me in circles. It was after my… fourth? Fifth?—I couldn’t count at that point if that’s any sign of how many I had—that I finally stumbled from the dorm. I don’t think Blake Finn or Richard knew I left. I just left. I was swept into the wave of people, carried on a tide. I don’t remember a whole lot. I knew I wanted to get outside. I remember thinking it was hot, and my head hurt badly. I was giggling a little, thinking it was so funny that I didn’t even know these people. I didn’t know them but I had drank from them like I had been thirsty for weeks. That was funny to me. I had finally done something rebellious. 

I had somehow made it down the stairwell and into the street below. The air was so cold. I kind of remember that. I guess, thinking back, I’m imagining it more cold than I thought it was. I remember running my hands on my arms, and my skin prickled with gooseflesh. I had thought ‘But I’m not even that cold’. But my teeth had chattered, and people around me were in heavy coats and I left mine upstairs. I don’t remember taking it off, but I was suddenly only in a tank top.
 
Stumbling down the street with no goal in mind, I had just walked. I knew I wanted to go somewhere. I didn’t want to be in there anymore. I think I remember that, but it wasn’t a thought. It was just a feeling. I felt like I wanted to leave. I felt uncomfortable. I wanted to crawl from my skin and exist as An Other for just a while. Because it was hot and cold, my chest hurt still, and my head buzzed and stung angrily at every light. 

My feet hurt after a while. But, I had thought, I was standing a lot before. Blake pulled me around so much. Yeah, I decided that was it. Never mind that I didn’t know where I was anymore. It was dark and there were only streetlights, and I didn’t know where I was but my feet hurt because of Blake.

Someone had come up to me. I don’t remember their face. It was blurry and dark. I remember they were a man. Tall, I think. At least a foot higher than I was at that time. He had a shock of blond hair. I think. Again, it was quite dark. I wish I could remember more. You see, being as drunk as I was (because I was hammered, no matter how much I would hate to have admitted it at that time), I don’t recall most of that night. Most of the finer details. Most of what I’m saying now is fuzzy, and I’m only guessing. 

But I know for certain that he smiled at me in that dark. It was wolfish. It sent a clear shoot of anxious electricity into my gut, cutting straight through the drunken haze. That hunter’s smile soon enough melted into something sweeter, making me think I imagined that look. Thinking back, it wasn’t a mistake. I didn’t imagine that. I should have seen him for who he was from the start. I don’t know why I didn’t. I thought that I was imagining things in the dark and my drunkenness. That was silly. That was a mistake.

“You out here alone?” He had asked. He stepped, slightly, into the streetlight I was under. I saw him a little better, but not enough. If I saw him in a police lineup, I couldn’t pick him out from any other blond man. 

I had ‘um’d for a while, my hip jutting. I was drunk. It was clear just from how my ‘um’ sounded. I knew he knew. I didn’t think that at the time. But later--Now. I think it now. I see it now. In the way he had gotten that little glint in his eye, surveyed me a little more carefully, starting to look around at our surroundings a bit, checking for anyone that could be around.

There was a strange sensation in my stomach then. It made me quite uncomfortable. I remember it well because it had made me shift. My stomach hurt worse suddenly. I felt twisty. I wanted to puke. I had ignored it. That was my first mistake. Or maybe my second. Or third. Did my mistakes start with my drinking, or with my leaving? Maybe it started with me going to the party.

“Well, I mean, I was with some friends. I should get back to them.” I responded. My speech was slurred. I was practically talking in cursive at that point. I applauded myself for remembering that women shouldn’t tell random people that they’re alone, but that wasn’t good enough. I should have been more insistent. I should have said I was with people, that I was going to them, that they had my location. I should have called them, texted them, FaceTimed them. Even a pretend call would have been enough. My phone was heavy and uncomfortable in my bra, tucked away and warm and untouched.

The guy had shrugged a heavy shoulder. I had watched, through clouded vision, as his eyes darted around once more before landing on me. “Do they know you’re gone? Or could you come with me for a bit? We could have some fun. Go hit some bars.” 

I had hesitated for a beat too long. He knew I was panicking. 

“Uhhh, they do know. Yeah. I’m going back to them. They’re waiting. Probably gonna get a call—,” *hiccup* “—soon.”

He shrugged again. Looked around. Back to me. There was something impatient in his gaze then. Another anxious twist of my gut had me itching to run. 

“So? They could wait a bit.” 

I shifted my weight on my feet. I was uncomfortable. I also didn’t know how to say no. “I d’nno. They’d notice…” I muttered. 

Most of what happened past then was a blur. I remember some. Some sensations were brighter than others. The bright lights of somewhere. Loud voices of people I didn’t know. The way my feet ached. I think he took me to a different party, or maybe just his place. He didn’t need to keep a drink in my hand, I was already incoherent, grasping at consciousness.

It was almost morning when I fully blacked out. When I woke, I was in my bed. Blake was fretting over me at the end of my bed. She told me I had been missing for hours and she only found me through the tracker we kept on each other through our phones. I had been passed out in a some guy’s apartment with his face in my neck.

I had asked if it was evident if anything happened to me. She had said no, that I looked awful though and there was vomit on me. She didn’t know if it was mine or not. But she shoved me in her car, showered me off, brushed my teeth for me (I was half coherent, she reported, and instructed her weakly of what I wanted and she obliged, glad I was alive at least and could speak)and put me in bed. 

A headache ripped at my skull. I thought my head might split right into two, and I had told Blake this. She scurried away to get me pills water and some food. I had been asleep for a while, she said. Hours and hours in bed. I missed half of the day, and it was almost two already. I worried about my tests today, and she told me to not worry about them. So I didn’t. It hurt my head too much more to think about anything anyway. 

I wonder if you remember this now. This part is where it’s getting important because it’s where I meet you. Do you remember now?
