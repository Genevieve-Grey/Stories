In the dead heat of the summer of ’05, I shove my hand into the overgrown blackberry bush behind my house. It grew wild from early 2000 until just earlier this year when it was chopped down to its roots. The vines, thorny and dark, stretched over the fence posts, cascading over and enveloping anything it could touch. My hands stung as the thorns dug into my soft flesh, tearing my palms open and leaving them raw and red. But the berries, glinting in the sunlight as I unearthed them, were ripe and just beneath a layer of brambles.

Luke, who had only been a school friend until that day, stood behind me, wringing his hands. They would stay unmarred that summer, his fingers flying in an anxious frenzy when he approached the thorns. I stepped up from beside him, declaring that I wanted the berries, too, and plunged into the bush without a second thought. 

I retrieved one, two, three, four berries and withdrew my arm. It stung with a fire that I hadn’t yet felt in my life, not even when I tried my hand at riding a bike for the first time and fell, skidding my knees against the pavement and promising I would never, ever get on a bike again. I handed two berries to Luke, pinching my two between my fingers, just enough so the juice would trickle over my bleeding hand. 

Luke, small and shockingly blond, cupped the berries in his hands with a reverence I had only seen in my grandmother’s eyes at church. He stared from me to the berries the same way she gazed up at the carving of Jesus above the altar, the delicate engraving of blood trickling down his bent head, arms pinned to his sides with the wood-carved nails.

What was he waiting for? I tossed my head back, throwing the berries into the air and catching them in my mouth. I bit my teeth into them, savoring their freshness, the dirt and gritiness that still covered their skin, the warmth from baking in the heat. Luke followed my example, throwing one berry into the air. It hit his teeth and bounced away, rolling into the tall grass. His face set in disappointed determination and he threw the other up against the cloudless sky. This one did not even come near him, flying straight over his head and landing somewhere over the fence. 

“Sorry.” He muttered in my direction, his eyes falling to the ground, to the grass swaying around our ankles.
It didn’t take another moment of thought for me to shove my hand back into the bush, my teeth grinding against the stinging pain, my fingers grazing against more plump berries. I plucked three more for him and deposited them in his waiting hands. 
He ate them slowly, inspecting each one before putting them in his mouth. For a moment, my summer froze, suspended in the moment of watching my new friend cautiously eat the berries I bled for, the heavy, warm taste of blackberry still lingering on the back of my tongue. The sun baked down on us, heating the top of my head, but in the throes of childhood, that was the last thing on my mind.

I can never eat another blackberry and not wish for that summer, not want for the fruit to be fresher, warmer, to stain my teeth purple and fill my meals until I couldn’t stand to face another berry until the season ended, the leaves on the bush in my yard wilting, the vines curling into themselves before dropping to the brown carpet of grass.

In the summer of 2020, I stand in the cold air conditioning of the grocery store, contemplating the blackberries in the fridge, wondering if it’s worth spending nearly five dollars on fruit I deemed only okay.

“Can you decide already?” Luke asks from behind me. He nudges the back of my legs with the cart, already full of raspberries, bread, cheese, and little boxes of apple juice. There is a picnic blanket in the back of his car and my camera in a bag under his seat. The day is hot, but a cool breeze reminds us that it is the end of August and September is already slipping into the weather and coffee orders.

I grab the box of blackberries, not wanting to think another moment about what I can’t get back. Shoving them in the cart alongside the raspberries, I follow Luke to the checkout and then to his car, loading the bags of groceries up, and then we’re ready to take off for our outing. 

The park we go to, a wide stretch of grass bordered by trees and a playground tucked into the corner, has been our choice location to relax on the weekends for years now. We haul our bags and blanket to the same spot we have always gone to, just within the tree line and away from any screaming children.

Luke and I lay parallel to each other on the blanket, the food stretched out in the space between us, my camera lying on my hip. The sun, falling on us in intense waves, warms the places where the trees don’t cover. I feel him beside me, his presence magnetic. I can’t ignore him, act like he isn’t there. 

I don’t need to turn to him to know he’s looking at me, the way his gaze burns the side of my face.

“What are you thinking about?” He asks. His voice is loud in the near silence, the soft rustling of grass and the wind in the trees.

“You know. Work.”

Luke murmurs that he agrees. His arms slide up to rest behind his head.

“You work later tonight?”

“No. You?”

“No.”

“Come over later?” I can’t help the tilt at the end of my voice, the question in my words. The wondering. In between the jump in my tone, I’m asking, *please*?

“Sounds great. Want to watch a movie?”

“Sure.”

I turn to him, and he’s already looking back at the sky, a faint smile on his lips. My chest clenching makes it hard to breathe. I know I am devoted to him; I have been since we were five, and he put a bandaid over my bleeding fingers, still sticky and purple from the berries, and kissed them. I knew when we sat across from each other on the floor of my childhood bedroom, and I asked him when he felt most loved, and he said when I’m with you.
	
“What movie do you want to watch?” I ask. He sits up, his brow furrowing to darken his eyes, as he pops open the lid of raspberries. 
	
“Something we haven’t seen before.”
	
“There are a lot of options there.”
	
We pass ideas back and forth. The fruit is nearly gone, the bread torn into and the cheese crudely picked apart to sit in ragged slices on the bread. We don’t make any decision in the end, deciding to ‘just wing it’ and figure it out later tonight. 

It’s already been nearly an hour of baking in the sun, and the heat on the top of my head is proof of this. A cool breeze has swept rainclouds over the sky, spotting the blue and just barely beginning to cover the sun. Luke rolls over to face me, his head propped up on his hand. He nudges my camera with his leg.

“Taking any pictures today?”
	
“Probably. Wanna be my model?”
	
“You know I will be.”
	
He sits up, draping his arms over his knees and watching as I unpack my camera, snapping the lens onto the body. When I angle the camera up, he smiles just slightly so the corners of his eyes crinkle. I snap a picture of him. 
	
“Get up. Do something.” I instruct him firmly, waving my hand and motioning for him to go away. He cracks a grin and hops up, pacing the blanket before wandering off into the expanse of grass. 

I stand and follow him, watching him through the lens of my camera. In the small box I see him walking towards the gray horizon. The wind sweeps through his hair as he turns halfway to me. I snap a picture. He turns back, arms swinging, and I see a smile pass over his lips. Just before his back is turned to me, I get another picture. 

The photoshoot ends soon after. I don’t look at the photos now but I vow to later. We sit back on the blanket and bite into the blackberries. The seeds crack my teeth. I roll them around in my mouth like stones or marbles, feeling out their smoothness with my tongue. Luke swallows them whole, tossing them high into the air and catching them on his darkened tongue. They’re warming from the day’s heat, softening, unraveling in tangy juice and pulp. Our hands are soon sticky and wet from the juice, dyed a bruised blue-purple, dripping down our forearms. 

I reach over and press a finger into Luke’s cheek, drawing a smiling face onto his skin with the pulp. He barely contains a laugh, waiting for me to finish my art, before turning to me. His finger traces my cheek, drawing up to just under my eye. His fingers are trembling, hardly maintained gentleness, just a brush across my warmed skin. I want to steady his hand and tell him he won’t hurt me; I want to be reminded of the blackberry bush I scarred myself in, summers ago. He pulls away, grinning, proclaiming he drew a perfect flower. I don’t want to look, knowing it will likely look like anything but a flower, but I agree that it must be perfect and don’t wipe it away. 

He drives us home an hour later when the sky marbles in a mottled gray and raindrops begin to splatter onto our crude blackberry face paint. The air is heavy and metallic, sitting in the back of my throat with a familiar taste. I told Luke years ago that the name for this scent is petrichor, and now he turns to me and repeats this definition with a smile. I can’t look at him when he grins, as if proud, of remembering or of me.
